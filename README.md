DayZ cfgweather.xml files for Livonia from the Xbox server DayZHaRP. Includes spring, summer, autumn (fall) and winter (with snow).

------------------------------------------------------------
DayZ Weather Files From DZHaRP | Xbox                      -
These are the weather files I use and edit for the server. -
------------------------------------------------------------

1. How to use it.

- Download your original cfg.weather.xml
  - Rename the original file to something you can find easily and save it to a local file.
- Download the file you wish to use.
- Rename the new file to cfgweather.xml (ensure it's saved as an XML file).
- Upload it to your dayzOffline.enoch folder.
*Do not delete the cfgweather.xml from the folder. Just upload one over the top.*
- You can edit these files to suit your server style.

**ALWAYS download your original file for later use if needed.**

**ALWAYS validate files, even when taken from here (they are validated already).**

**ALWAYS validate your files after making even minor edits.**

2. Descriptions

Here are descriptions of what each file will be like.

SPRING

Mostly clear skies without much cloud and some rain. Some misty fog. The world will be mostly sunny and bright with some windy days.

SUMMER

Little cloud, very little-no rain, sunny most of the time. No fog at all and some very windy days.

AUTUMN / FALL

A lot of thick grey cloud, foggy days with no rain and not much wind.

WINTER

Lots of white/grey clouds, lots of fog and snow without much wind.

3. Editing
4. 
If you want to edit the files with ease for different results here are some simple changes.

- Set the limits min & limits max of the "overcast" weather and set the threshold of the rain to overlap, meaning it will rain more or less often.
E.g; Overcast limits min=0.85 and limits max=1.0 will mean it will be cloudy a lot. Setting the threshold of the rain to be limits min=0.85 and limits max=1.0 will mean constant rain.
- Setting the overcast limits min and max to 0 will remove the clouds entirely. Then setting the rain to a higher min than 0.0 means it will not rain.
